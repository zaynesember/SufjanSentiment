We are a servant, we have a song
The side of a beehive, a tabernacle choir
We are the sound working in wars
The bishop is gone to the acolyte shores

We save our Bibles, we pull our sleeves
The word is a guard and the guard is a cleave
We are the right, we are the stay
The accolade's gone, we are what you say

We have no language, we have no chore
The side of a beehive, the bride is a whore
We are a spite, we are at bay
The spirit is life, we are what you say

We have a sermon, we have a song
The bishop is easy, the bishop is wrong
The spirit is right, the spirit will say
We are a light, we are what you say
 
Like it's killing me
It's kidding me around
This bite, You bit on me
You put on me a gown

 
That fits me like a quarter door
That hits me like a sound
It's like You shut on me
Or shouldn't be around

Like the fennel seed
The funny gene You found
I like the man-o-weeds
The man-o-wars abound

That fits me like a quarter door
That hits me like a sound
I might just win a war
A matador around

 
There's still nothing I can say to change
My news for You
There's still nothing You can do to exchange
My dues to You
 
Like you fit on me
To bit on me a bound
This life that's shut on me
That shouldn't be the grounds
To emulate an Epicene
To elevate a sound
This life, a winner needs
A winner needs a wand

 
Never want to blame You
Bound You, blame me
Never want the blame You bound
Never want to blame You
Bound me, blame You
Never want the fame You found
And where's the same
And where's the strong
And where's the guard
And where's the one who tries to make You


I never felt so safe
A line I once told her
Warm resting place
Her arm on my shoulder


You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself


We ran into a safe
When the walls came closer
She turned into a cave
Where it turned colder


My sister had two ba-babies
At one time
They were s-siamese twins
No, they were actually, they were connected at the heads
At the head
And the doctor cut them apart, and my sister said
"I have two kids now
Look at me"
A summer night
I find a boat
Tied to a tree
A normal home

She lost her string
And stepping in
I push the shore there
An act of stealth

A troubled glad without a voice
A mountain song, the boat moves on
The water runs on either side
The circle swell, a sudden light
Takes me


Takes me
Takes me
Takes me
Takes me

I fix my view
Upon the ridge
Horizon's eye
Above the gray sky
I tip my oar to raise the stroke
The wading swan, the image broke
A looming peak, a pirate size
Uprears its head a sudden guise
Takes me

One time, this kid ate too much food, and the food started coming out of his stomach, out of his belly button, there was maggots coming out of his belly button
I'm taking you down
To the placement field
And when I find you
Underneath the grass, I know you
Feel this way, you feel this way

Because I know you
And I feel you
And I'll feed you rice pudding
At the benefit concert

Yeah baby, I'll feed you rice pudding
At the concert

Rock-n-roll, sugar cane
Such a shame that I can't get over this
Put the axle on and roll again

Such a Saturn eye will close again
Watching every ring turning again

And I close my eyes
To everything you've rearranged
And I close my mind
To everything you've kept the same
Put the axle on and roll again

Cannot keep you in my bed again
Wake up every time, leave your space again

When the hairline breaks and lets you in
To the woman you've turned red again
"Oh, who is that? She looks good. What's your name?"

"My name is Lauramechbaidumeinchbib Beautiful Lovely Lady. Did you hear what I said?"

"Yeah, sure I did"

"I am, uh, Chriskpalpidon"

"Ah, you wanna know what my name is?"

"What, big fella?"

"Oh, my name is, um, Godzuki"

"Ya big fella! Godzuki reminds me of a booger. Goodbye!"

She's a superhuman girl

And an electronic feather

She's got a super long tongue
And spandex underwear
She's got a Superman smile
And Wonder Woman's hair

Cave the Cadmus country soon
Europa's sake he drew
Until the oracle said wander

Safe libation water slew
A serpent near him knew
The dragon's teeth he threw
Until the oracle said wander

Like the lantern on a tree
Your burden bright as weary be
Periwig on parakeet
You're God's great paramour and sweet


I'm happy, I'm happy
Your birthday brings a pardoning
I'm happy, I'm happy
You're like a bird that will not be


Yours will number, yours will be
A paragon, a Paraclete
Keep your bed warm, keep your humor
Keep your proverbs short and sweet


I'm sorry, I'm sorry
That life is anxious, life is mean
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
A pair of shoes is what you need


I'm happy, I'm happy
Your birthday brings a pardoning
I'm happy, I'm happy
You're like a bird that will not be

Jason, you're the only one
Jason, like a steady son
Like that, you're the only one
Take that, when the runner's come


When the right dragon comes around
When the knight horses burn the ground


Jason, you're the only one
Jason, like a steady son


You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one


Jason, you're the circle sun
Jason, run the rabbit run
Like that, you're the steady gun
Like that, what the Argon won

When the right dragon comes around
When the knight horses burn the ground
When the right you gave me
To make it through the night
When the right dragon comes around


You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one


When we were young and noble
You're the only one
Riding on a plane for freedom run
You're the only one
A plane for freedom run
You're the only one
When we were young and noble
You're the only one
Riding on a plane for freedom run
You're the only one
A plane for freedom run
You're the only one
When we were young and noble
You're the only one
Riding on a plane for freedom run
You're the only one
A plane for freedom run
You're the only one
When we were young and noble
You're the only one
Riding on a plane for freedom run
You're the only one
A plane for freedom run
You're the only one

You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one

He took the stable
Bred me to be a mare
Made the brethren able
Gave me a room


I never asked him
I never meant to stay
He dressed the table
Wore a dress to be my mare


There's no permanence
When you never leave the stall
He ran to other wars
Won't write me at all


I want to kill him
I want to cut his brain
And when it's over
I know I'll feel okay


He was a champion
We were riding side by side
Into the frontier
He left me without a ride

Where did the hour go
When the champions intercede?
He stole the cargo
Took every chance to leave


There's no permanence
When you never leave the stall
He ran to other wars
Won't write me at all


I want to kill him
I want to cut his brain
And when it's over
I know I'll feel okay


I want to kill him
I want to cut his face
And when it's over
I know I'll feel okay


I want
I want
I want
I want

'Ah ya eayni ya layl
Everything you are
Is everything we have
You're the only good thing
A sun came
Burned our faces round
Burned our faces red
You are still the rage, a rock
From the enemy
There is still a house, a cage
For the enemy
When my friends turned out, I found out
There is still a Lord
But I never felt so lonely
A sun came
I remember when my mother would get sick
She would vomit all over the kitchen
She would vomit on the tables and on the countertops
And in the refrigerator, and we called the dog
And the dog would come in and slip on the vomit

I would like to throw a field
Yes, I would like to be a man
I would send the Kingdom's field
Yes, I would enter to the end

Blessed is the man who waits
And blessed is the man who starts

Hey, Shar?
Yes, Sufjan?
So, what do you believe in?
Oh, a lot of things
Oh yeah, like what?
Well, peace and justice for all

In the middle when you came
Will the animals invite?
Every syllable the same
Every letter, every line

I never felt so safe
A line I once told her
Warm, resting place
Her arms on my shoulder

You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself

You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself

We ran into a cave
When the wars came closer
She turned into a cave
Where it turned colder

You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself

You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself
You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself

You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself
