I would like to throw a field
Yes, I would like to be a man
I would send the Kingdom's field
Yes, I would enter to the end

Blessed is the man who waits
And blessed is the man who starts

Hey, Shar?
Yes, Sufjan?
So, what do you believe in?
Oh, a lot of things
Oh yeah, like what?
Well, peace and justice for all

In the middle when you came
Will the animals invite?
Every syllable the same
Every letter, every line

I believe in peace
