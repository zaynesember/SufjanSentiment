Something's suddenly unclear
Someone's suddenly my fear
My eyes demand like broken eaves
The ladle overspills on eaves

If you once knew
How I loved you

And my bruise-colored eyes peel
Every image to your face and heel
And if you're happy, I am too
And if you're sleeping, I'm with you

But you love someone else
But you want to be with someone else
And I can't believe how dumb I sound
And I will put my face over the ground

But you love someone else
But you want to be with someone else
And I can't believe how dumb I sound
And I will put my face over the ground

And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
And love you
