Like the lantern on a tree
Your burden bright as weary be
Periwig on parakeet
You're God's great paramour and sweet

I'm happy, I'm happy
Your birthday brings a pardoning
I'm happy, I'm happy
You're like a bird that will not be

Yours will number, yours will be
A paragon, a Paraclete
Keep your bed warm, keep your humor
Keep your proverbs short and sweet

I'm sorry, I'm sorry
That life is anxious, life is mean
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
A pair of shoes is what you need

I'm happy, I'm happy
Your birthday brings a pardoning
I'm happy, I'm happy
You're like a bird that will not be
