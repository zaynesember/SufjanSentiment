He took the stable
Bred me to be a mare
Made the brethren able
Gave me a room

I never asked him
I never meant to stay
He dressed the table
Wore a dress to be my mare

There's no permanence
When you never leave the stall
He ran to other wars
Won't write me at all

I want to kill him
I want to cut his brain
And when it's over
I know I'll feel okay

He was a champion
We were riding side by side
Into the frontier
He left me without a ride

Where did the hour go
When the champions intercede?
He stole the cargo
Took every chance to leave

There's no permanence
When you never leave the stall
He ran to other wars
Won't write me at all

I want to kill him
I want to cut his brain
And when it's over
I know I'll feel okay

I want to kill him
I want to cut his face
And when it's over
I know I'll feel okay

I want
I want
I want
I want
