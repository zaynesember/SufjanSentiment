Jason, you're the only one
Jason, like a steady son
Like that, you're the only one
Take that, when the runner's come

When the right dragon comes around
When the knight horses burn the ground

Jason, you're the only one
Jason, like a steady son

You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one

Jason, you're the circle sun
Jason, run the rabbit run
Like that, you're the steady gun
Like that, what the Argon won

When the right dragon comes around
When the knight horses burn the ground
When the right you gave me
To make it through the night
When the right dragon comes around

You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one

When we were young and noble
You're the only one
Riding on a plane for freedom run
You're the only one
A plane for freedom run
You're the only one
When we were young and noble
You're the only one
Riding on a plane for freedom run
You're the only one
A plane for freedom run
You're the only one
When we were young and noble
You're the only one
Riding on a plane for freedom run
You're the only one
A plane for freedom run
You're the only one
When we were young and noble
You're the only one
Riding on a plane for freedom run
You're the only one
A plane for freedom run
You're the only one

You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
