When your heirloom’s wilted brown
When the devil’s pushing down
When your mourning has a sound
And you hesitate to laugh
How quickly will your joy pass?
How quickly will your joy pass?

And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out, just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more

La, la, la
La-la-la-la-la
La, la, la
La-la-la-la-la

So do you think I came to fight?
And do I always think I’m right?
Oh no, I never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
Oh no, I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time

And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out, just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I’ll never let it push your arms no more
