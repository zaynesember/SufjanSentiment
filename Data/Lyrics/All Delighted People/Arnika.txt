Arnica might
Take out the throes
That I threw in my head
Bruno, your wife
Shakes the bedclothes
As she makes up your bed

I’m tired of life
I’m tired of waiting for someone
I’m tired of prices
I’m tired of waiting for something

I have a right
To know what’s in store
To know what should be said
Could I have it all?
Could I have you for a night
In the warmth of your bed?

I’m tired of life
I’m tired of waiting for someone
I’m tired of prices
I’m tired of waiting for something

I’m tired of life, I’m tired of life
I’m tired of life, I’m tired of life
I’m tired of life, I’m tired of life

Oh be patient with me
For the night weighs on my chest
With a terrible storm
Though we may disagree
On how things should be done
On how crisis is born
Don’t consider it done
Wait until Leviathan
Lovingly creeps in your sill
For he waits in the dark
Brooding magically
Mustering paperback feelings

No I’m not afraid
Of death or strife or injury
Accidents, they are my friends
