If I was a different man
If I had blood in my eyes
I could have read of your heart
I could have read of your mind
But now I'm lonely instead, I put up a fight
So pick up your battering ram, love
I want to see it

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
Anyway

And maybe I talk too fast
And maybe I talk too much
Give me the sensitive laugh
Or give me the sensitive touch
Even if I could have kissed
And even if I could be the blood
I'm so sorry I tried, love
I want to see it

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
Anyway

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that
Anyway

La, la la la la, la la la la, la
La, la la la la, la la la la, la
(There's too much riding on that)
La, la la la la, la la la la, la
La, la la la la, la la la la, la
(There's too much riding on that)
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that word

There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that

There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
