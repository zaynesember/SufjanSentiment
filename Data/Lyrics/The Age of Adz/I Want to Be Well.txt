To think that I would die this time
Isolated in the room where the bed rises
Photographic ordinary people are everywhere
Extraordinary histories, ordinary histories, ordinary histories

I'll find sleep, I'll find peace
Or in death we sleep with ease

To figure that it was my fault
Or so I've come to realize life is not about
Love to some and (ordinary people are everywhere)
Extraordinary people are, ordinary people are, ordinary people are

Everywhere you look, everywhere you turn
Illness is watching, waiting its turn

Did I go at it wrong?
Did I go intentionally to destroy me?
I'm suffering in noise I'm suffering in (touching ordinary bodies)
The burning from within the burning from with (ordinary hysteria)
I could not be at rest, I could not be at peace (extraordinary hysteria)

So do yourself a good (so do yourself a good), or do yourself a death (or do yourself a death) from ordinary (do yourself a good) causes (do yourself a good)
Or do yourself a favor (or do yourself a good), or do yourself a death (do yourself a death) from ordinary (do yourself a good) causes

Illness likes to prey upon the lonely, prey upon the lonely
When it bites, oh, I would rather be dead
I would rather give up

I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be well

And I forgive you even (I want to be well, I want to be well
I want to be)
As you choke me that way (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
With the pill or demon (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
And the shrouded shalom (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
Under conversation (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
In tremendous weight of (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
A crowd of ages outside (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
Dressed for murder (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not (well, I want to be well, I want to be well, I)


And shall I kiss you even
As you take me that way?
With the pill or demon
As my body changes
Apparitions gone awry
They surround me, all sides
But from within I see it, unholy changes

I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around (well, I want to be well, I want to be)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not (well, I want to be well, well I to be well, well, I)
