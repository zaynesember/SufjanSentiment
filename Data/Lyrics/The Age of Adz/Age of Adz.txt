Oh, oh, it rots
Oh, oh, it rots
Oh, oh, it rots

Well I have known you for just a little while
But I feel I've known you, I feel I've seen you when the Earth was split in fives
And in your words, I should let it out, I would see it die
But I'm a watcher, I see it watch her, it's in your afterlife
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

Oh keep from trying, oh keep from caring
You are the life
We see you trying to be something else that you're not
We think you're nice
The circumstances of what I thought, I could see it now
I wouldn't be so, I wouldn't feel so, but it's a running wild
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

When it dies, when it dies, it rots
And when it lives, when it lives it gives it all it gots
This is the Age of Adz eternal living

Oh, oh, it rots
Oh, oh, it gives it all it gots
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

And all reflections, I see your method, I see it all
And what about you? And what about me? Are we the lost of lost?
Don't speak too soon, don't be fruit o' loom, don't excite yourself
For what you see is not fantasy, it's not what it gets, but gives
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

And all reflections, I see it mentioned, I see it all
The gorgeous mess of your face impressed us, imposed in all its art
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

When it dies, when it dies, it rots
And when it lives, when it lives it gives it all it gots
This is the Age of Adz eternal living

Oh, oh, it rots
Oh, oh, it gives it all it gots
This is the Age of Adz, eternal living

When I die, when I die I'll rot
But when I live, when I live I'll give it all I've got
When I die, when I die I'll rot
But when I live, when I live I'll give it all I've got
Gloria, Gloria - it rots
Victoria, Victoria - it lives in all of us
Gloria, Gloria - it rots
Victoria, Victoria - it lives in all of us

I've lost the will to fight
I was not made for life
I've lost the will to fight
I was not made for life

Now I have known you for just a little while
I feel I must be wearing my welcome
I must be moving on
For my intentions were good intentions
I could have loved you, I could have changed you
I wouldn't be so, I wouldn't feel so
Consumed by selfish thoughts
I'm sorry if I seem self-effacing
Consumed by selfish thoughts
It's only that I still love you deeply
It's all the love I got
