To bear it down, to be in flight
To bear it down, to be in flight
It wasn't about me, it was only a stone in my shoe
Then worries came to perch on us
Impatience and a painted bust
I kept you close to me, close to my ear

We set out once with folded shirts
With hairy chest and all rehearsed
I want it all, I want it all for myself
I'll set it right between your eyes
Your shoulder blade, your running life
I want it all, I want it all for myself

Improving all the time, I am
Improving as I kiss the hem
I promise I won't be a trouble at all
For I'm okay, I'm in the red
Impressions of the unmade bed
You cradled close to me, close to my ear

We set out once, forget our shirts
With hairy chests and well-rehearsed
I want it all, I want it all for myself
For in the earth I smell of you
A bathing boy, amazing view
I want it all, I want it all for myself
