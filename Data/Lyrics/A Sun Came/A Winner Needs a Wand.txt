Like it's killing me
It's kidding me around
This bite, You bit on me
You put on me a gown

That fits me like a quarter door
That hits me like a sound
It's like You shut on me
Or shouldn't be around

Like the fennel seed
The funny gene You found
I like the man-o-weeds
The man-o-wars abound

That fits me like a quarter door
That hits me like a sound
I might just win a war
A matador around

There's still nothing I can say to change
My news for You
There's still nothing You can do to exchange
My dues to You

Like you fit on me
To bit on me a bound
This life that's shut on me
That shouldn't be the grounds
To emulate an Epicene
To elevate a sound
This life, a winner needs
A winner needs a wand

Never want to blame You
Bound You, blame me
Never want the blame You bound
Never want to blame You
Bound me, blame You
Never want the fame You found

Like it's killing me
It's kidding me around
This bite, You bit on me
You put on me a gown

Like you fit on me
To bit on me a bound
This life that's shut on me
That shouldn't be the grounds
To emulate an Epicene
To elevate a sound
This life, a winner needs
A winner needs a wand

Never want to blame You
Bound You, blame me
Never want the blame You bound
Never want to blame You
Bound me, blame You
Never want the fame You found

And where's the same?
And where's the strong?
And where's the guard?
And where's the one who tries to make You?
