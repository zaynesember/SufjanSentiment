I never felt so safe
A line I once told her
Warm resting place
Her arm on my shoulder

You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself
You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself

We ran into a safe
When the walls came closer
She turned into a cave
Where it turned colder

You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself
You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself
You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself
You are the rock
You are the rake
You are the one when I watch myself
