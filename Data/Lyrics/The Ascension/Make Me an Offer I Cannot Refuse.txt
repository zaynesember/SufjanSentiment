Move me
Move like the waters I cannot drink
I have lost my patience
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move through to me
Show me the face of all of my dreams
Was it all for nothing?
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move through to me
Move like the ghost of a hazardous demon
Was it all forgiven?
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move like a centipede
Foolish as I am, follow my lead
I have lost my preference
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move through to me
Show me the face of the radical dream
There's no time for innocence
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Shall you refuse me? (Shall you refuse me?)
Show me the face of the radical dream
There's no time for severance
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Shall you abuse me? (Shall you abuse me?)
Show me the grace of a natural king
Lord, I need deliverance
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
