Four degrees off the ground
I am lost, forgive me
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost, forgive me
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost, forgive me
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost, forgive me
(Only the lonely)

Reach out for what remains before you
Reach out for what remains at hand
For as it was in the beginning
So shall it cease at my command
(Only the lonely)
Now place your head below your waistline
Breathe deeply as the pain subsides
And with your final breath, remember
The day of rest has now arrived
(Only the lonely)

Oh, my heart will leave you now, surrender
Oh, my heart receives you now
With arms full of harvest
Oh, my heart has fallen for its fear of feelings
Stay close to me, my love
Theosophy, in elegy love me
Oh, my heart will fantasize of Eden
My love, my dream, make love to me
Surrender your spirit, sing my eulogy
Oh, my heart is chained to thee, my angel
You haven't seen the last of me
My love, I give you everything

Four degrees off the ground
I am lost without you (Only the lonely)
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost without you (Only the lonely)
I am lost without you (Only the lonely)
I am lost without you (Only the lonely)
