(I'm your ticket tonight)
(I'm your ticket tonight)
(I'm your ticket tonight)

Here I am alone in my car
Hopelessness incorporated
I'm driving to wherever you are
Now that all of my dreams have been confiscated
Circa 1975
Now that it's too late to have died a young man
Well, I'm just glad that I'm still alive
For what hasn't killed me will make me stronger

Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact

Tell me what I already know
Nothing is left of me, all of this is vertigo
Turn around and show me your shadow
Now that I've left you, I feel all the afterglow

Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to everything out of whack

Here I am alone in my car (I'm your ticket tonight)
Hopelessly infatuated
Now I'm driving to wherever you are (I'm your ticket tonight)
Love me and leave me intoxicated

Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to everything out of whack

(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
