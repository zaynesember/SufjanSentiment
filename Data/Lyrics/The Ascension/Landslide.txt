It was something of a second life
It was something of an anaphylaxis
I saw the same shit, I saw the light
You get me out of this and I'll give you access
At the risk of sounding like a Confucian
I saw your body and I saw what I liked
Let's keep it simple, give me absolution
Let's take a walk in the circle of light

It was something of an afterthought
It was something sort of unprecedented
I saw the same shit, like it or not
I saw the hemisphere I didn't invent it
It was something of a reinvention
You took my breath away, I took my time
Let's keep it simple, give me absolution
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
(Landslide)
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
(Landslide)
Let's take a walk in the circle of light

We step in the light
The rise of our tide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide

It was something of a second chance
It was something of a phantom synapsis
Now everything is slipping out of my hands
You get me out of this and I'll give you access
At the risk of sounding like a Confucian
I'm gonna take it one day at a time
Let's keep it simple, give me absolution
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
(Landslide)
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
(Landslide)
Let's take a walk in the circle of light

We step in the light
The rise of our tide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide
