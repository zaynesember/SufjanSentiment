What the water wants is hurricanes
And sailboats to ride on its back
What the water wants is sun kiss
And land to run in to and back

And I have a fish stone
Burning my elbow
Reminding me to know that I'm glad

And I have a bottle
Filled with my old teeth
They fell out like a tear in the bag

And I have a sister
Somewhere in Detroit
She has black hair and small hands

And I have a kettledrum
I'll hit the earth with you
And I will crochet you a hat

And I have a red kite
I'll put you right in it
I'll show you the sky
