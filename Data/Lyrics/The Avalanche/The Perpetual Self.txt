Everything is lost, uh-oh
But I know that you can take it to the Lord
Everything you are, uh-oh
Isn't all that you can gather for yourself

Do you love a lot? Uh-oh
Is it love that you just kiss to everyone?
Is your loving lost? Uh-oh
Is it strange that you perpetuate yourself?
(All that he has given to the world
Is the joy that he will carry to the door)

All that he has given to the world
All that he has given to the world
(Uh-oh, is it strange that you perpetuate yourself?)
All that he has given to the world
(For what it costs, uh-oh)
All that he has given to the world
(Everything is lost, uh-oh)
All that he has given to the world
(Is the joy that he will carry to the door)
All that he has given to the world
(Still I know that you can take it to the war)
