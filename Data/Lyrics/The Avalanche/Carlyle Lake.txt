Oh, stop thinking of tomorrow, don't stop thinking of today
You're not getting any younger, you've got nothing to explain

You've got resolutions (You've got resolutions)
Fastening in your wake (Fastening in your wake)
Take instead the high tide (Take instead the high tide)
At the man-made lake (At the man-made lake)

It may take a while (It may take a while)
It may take all day (It may take all day)
All the implications (All the implications)
At the man-made lake (At the man-made lake)

Oh, stop thinking of tomorrow, don't stop thinking of today
You're not getting any younger, you've got nothing to explain
