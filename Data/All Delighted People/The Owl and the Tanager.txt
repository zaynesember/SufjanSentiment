All I had hoped for
I kept inside your car
The rabbit in the barn

Most of all I wait
I wait beside the door
I wait beside the door

All I was wrong
Trembling in the cage
I was diamonds in the cage

In seven hours I consider death
And your father called to yell at me
"You little boy, you little boy"

Found out you cheated me
I ran behind the barn
And cut my hands somehow

Blood in the meadowlark
I punched your ears instead
I punched you in the head
You only laughed and laughed and laughed

How I was wrong
Tingling from the kill
Tickle me until
You devil bird, you evil still

Slept on my arms
Sleeping in the sill
I was sleeping in the room with you
You little boy, you little boy

How could you run from me now?
The loneliest chime in the house
The loneliest chime in the house
You let it out, you let it out

Come to me Calvary still
I’m weeding and raking until
I’m bleeding in spite of my love for you
It bruised and bruised my will

Counting alluvial plains
The breathing inside of the range
You touched me inside of my cage
Beneath my shirt your hands embraced me

Come to me feathered and frayed
For I am the ugliest prey
For I am the ugliest prey
The owl, the reckless, reckless praise

You said you’d wait for me
Down by the Tannery Creek
Far out by the clothesline
Where we used to kiss behind the sheets
Wrapped in a blanket of red
The Owl and the Tanager said
The Owl and the Tanager said
One waits until the hour is death
