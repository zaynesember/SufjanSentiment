Tell me what you saw in me
And I’ll try to replicate it with a scene
If it troubles you to breathe
Wait a moment, I could change the scenery

Don’t carry on carrying efforts, oh no, oh oh oh
Somewhere there’s a room for each of us to grow
And if it pleases you to leave me, just go, oh oh oh
Stopping you would stifle your enchanting ghost

It’s only that I meant to bring
Love and liveliness to your breast on the scene
Did you cut your hands on me?
Are my edges sharp? Am I a pest to feed?

Don’t carry on carrying regrets, oh no oh oh oh
Somewhere there’s a room for us to speak alone
And if it grieves you to stay here, just go, oh oh oh oh
For I have no spell on you, it’s all a ghost

I still have the things you gave me
Four anointing oils, the paperweight you made
For should I haven’t carried them
Or buried them in the name of your ghost, my friend

Don’t carry on carrying efforts: don’t go! no oh oh
Stay with me until I sleep within your host
Or if it pleases you to leave me, just go, oh oh oh oh
Stopping you would stifle your enchanting ghost
