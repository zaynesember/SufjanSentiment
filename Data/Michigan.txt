It's the same outside
Driving to the riverside
I pretend to cry
Even if I cried alone

I forgot the start
Use my hands to use my heart
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone

Since the first of June
Lost my job and lost my room
I pretend to try
Even if I tried alone

I forgot the part
Lose my hands to use my heart
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died
All good thoughts in spite of righteousness
Is not the kind of thoughts in spite of greatness
Often not the State is advocation
If we form a power of recognition

Forget loss and perfect advocation
If it drops or stays in convocation
All we praise is all we want in commerce
All we praise is parties, foreign commerce
Entertain ideas of great communion
Shelter not materials in union
(All we praise is not the kind of commerce
That's the right solution!)

All good thoughts is not the act of doing
What we want but what we should. Improving
Properties, ideas, a woman's pleasure
Is empowered by love, a perfect measure!
(All we praise is not the kind of commerce
That's the right solution!)
I have called you children, I have called you son
What is there to answer if I'm the only one?
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Still I must obey, still I must invite

If there's anything to say
If there's anything to do
If there's any other way
I'll do anything for you

I was dressed embarrassment, I was dressed in wine
If you had a part of me, will you take your time?
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life?

Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If we ever make a mess
I'll do anything for you

I have called you preacher, I have called you son
If you have a father, or if you haven't one
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you

I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
Demonstrate I was raised from the start
By a priest and the maid on the part
Still I know what to wear on my back:
Michigan! Ponshewaing! Cadillac!

If I ever meant to go away
I was raised, I was raised
In the place, in the place
Still I often think of going back
To the farms, to the farms
Golden arms, golden arms
Start to remind me

If the lakes took the place of the sea
If the cars drove themselves, way to be
Opposite to the trains moving in
Rivers run interstate, Michigan

Still I never meant to go away
I was raised, I was raised
In the place, in the place
Still I often think of going back
To the farms, to the farms
Golden arms, golden arms

Tried to change the
Made in Michigan
I was raised, I was raised
In the place, in the place
Part to remind me

I live in America
With a pair of Payless shoes
The upper peninsula
And the television news
And I've seen my wife
At the K-Mart
In strange ideas
We live apart

I live in a trailer home
With a snow mobile, my car
The window is broken out
And the interstate is far 
I drove all night
To find my child
In strange ideas
He's been reviled

In strange ideas
In stranger times
I've no idea
What's right sometimes
I lost my mind
I lost my life
I lost my job
I lost my wife
All the time we spent in bed
Counting miles before we set
Fall in love and fall apart
Things will end before they start

Sleeping on Lake Michigan
Factories and marching bands
Lose our clothes in summertime
Lose ourselves to lose our minds
In the summer heat, I might

Once when our mother called
She had a voice of last year's cough
We passed around the phone
Sharing a word about Oregon
When my turn came, I was ashamed
When my turn came, I was ashamed


Once when we moved away
She came to Romulus for a day
Her Chevrolet broke down
We prayed it'd never be fixed or be found
We touched her hair, we touched her hair
We touched her hair, we touched her hair


When she had her last child
Once when she had some boyfriends, some wild
She moved away quite far
Our grandpa bought us a new VCR
We watched it all night, we grew up in spite of it
We watched it all night, we grew up in spite of it


We saw her once last fall
Our grandpa died in a hospital gown
She didn't seem to care
She smoked in her room and colored her hair
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
Oh, Sleeping Bear
Ran to the top and got scared
Of what I could see

Oh, Lamb of God
Tell us Your perfect design
And give us the rod

Oh, Sturgeon Bay
Covered completely in sand
And covered in sun

Oh, Saint Marie
Give up, the rocking boats drowned
The captain is done
If you happen to be educated
Time it marches on
Oh time it marches on
In the end there is a sacred show
Delivers every song
Delivers every song

Mourning steps and
Mourning gallivants
And mourning never shows
No mourning never slows
If the avatar reminds that it
Will never stand at all
Will never stand as tall

Since the water made it
Most to sail it
Made it most to song
It made it most to song
For the politics are not political
For what they stand
For not what they demand
Every senator and diplomat
Combines her certain part
A matter for the heart
Save yourself from recognition
Selflessness and quiet song
To better get along
(We love you. We chose to
We made to. We love you.)

If we concentrate and pull
Resources to the highest poll
To beat the highest pull, too
Ever we will conquer grief
And find it faster to resolve
The dead, to be absolved
And fed, to restore
If the advantageous
Reprimand misgivings
We won't grow
We will not ever know
We will not!
(Lift my life in healthy places!)
Oh God, hold me now
Oh Lord, hold me now
There's no other man who could raise the dead
So do what you can to anoint my head

Oh God, where are you now?
Oh Lord, say somehow
The devil is hard on my face again
The world is a hundred to one again

Would the righteous still remain?
Would my body stay the same?

Oh God, hold me now
Oh God, touch me now
There's no other man who could save the dead
There's no other garden to place our head

Would the righteous still remain?
Would my body stay the same?

There's no other man who could raise the dead
So do what you can to anoint my head

Oh God, hold me now
Oh Lord, touch me now

I always knew you
In your mother's arms
I have called your name
I've an idea
Placed in your mind

To be a better man
I've made a crown for you
Put it in your room

And when the bridegroom comes
There will be noise
There will be glad

And a perfect bed


And when you write a poem
I know the words
I know the sounds
Before you write it down
When you wear your clothes
I wear them too
I wear your shoes
And your jacket too
I always knew you
In your mother's arms

I have called you son
I've made amends
Between father and son

Or if you haven't one


Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design

Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms

Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
