Desperate measures lead to death
From the mouth of Gabriel
Who died in his sleep when the world was a very big mess
A very big mess
He saw too much
From now on I will look away from every accident
That may or may not come my way

Saw you were talking up above the Aleph room
Masquerading as a loom
Both of us saw things
No one else would see as well
From the mouth of Gabriel
No one else would hear as well
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel
From the mouth of Gabriel

Don’t be so sure of what you feel, it might as well be trouble
From now on just let the universe be your shelter from the enemy

Your face has changed
I hardly know who you are this time
And what a mess I’ve made of you
You probably would but I won’t let you run away
You probably should but I won’t let you run away this time

Don’t be afraid of loneliness, some refugee beside itself
Instead of what you’ve got
You probably would but I won’t let you go away
You probably should but I won’t let you go away this time

Your face has changed
I hardly know who you are this time
And when I came into your room
You tried to jump

Now I know this is strange to hear from the mouth of God
It was something like a scene from Mars
In a struggle between loves and lies
The angel kept his face covered for to keep his word
And while I spoke something left from my life
Forget about the past
Be at rest I’ll make things right
And while I held you at best you nearly died
Forget about the past
And I’ll try to make things right
