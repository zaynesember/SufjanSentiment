Oh, oh
Woman, tell me what you want and I'll calm down
Without bleeding out
With a broken heart that you stabbed for an hour
Woman
I was freaking out because I want you to know
My beloved, you are the lover of
My impossible soul
Woman, too
Promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes
I was wigging out
Too much worry, I could not get you at all
And you said what you want
You would laugh it off, but I know you won't go
Not for real, at last
Must you write it off for the impossible soul?
And I was in a dream
I was gone away without you, but not too slow
Lest I put it off
For I put it right for the impossible soul

And all I couldn't sing
I would say it all my life to you
If I could get you at all
Don't be a wreck
Trying to be something
That I wasn't at all

Seems I got it wrong
I was chasing after something that was gone
To the black of night
Now, I know it's not what I wanted at all
And you said something like
"All you want is all the world for yourself"
But all I want is the perfect love
Though I know it's small, I want love for us all

And all I couldn't sing
I would say it all my life to you
If I could get you at all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Trying to be something that I wasn't at all

Do you want to be afraid?
Do, ooh-ooh, you want to be afraid?
For life in the cage
Where courage's mate
Runs deep in the wake
For the scariest things
Are not half as enslaved

Don't be distracted
Don't be distracted


Do you want to be alone?
Do you want to be alone?
For life isn't stained
Of righteousness pain
The seed and the hail
All impossible flights
For an interesting light

Don't be distracted
Don't be distracted

Do you want to love me more?
Do you want to love me more?
For love is the breath
If water and wave
Is cursed by the same thing
That nurtured its shame
Is it worth all the work?

Don't be distracted
Don't be distracted

Have you failed to feel delight?
No, I don't want to feel pain
Have you failed to feel delight?
No, I don't want to feel pain
Instead of the life
Lived tired and lost
Have you left it at last?
Where it floundered its death
With the language of ghosts

Don't be distracted
Don't be distracted

Do you want to be afraid?
No, I don't want to feel pain
Do, ooh-ooh-ooh, you want to be afraid?
No, I don't want to feel pain
For life in the cage (For life in the cage)
Where courage's mate (Where courage's mate)
Runs deep in the wake (Runs deep in the wake)
For the scariest things (For the scariest things)
Are not half as enslaved (Are not half as enslaved)

Don't be distracted (don't be distracted)
Don't be distracted
Now

Don't be distracted (don't be distracted)
Don't be distracted
Now

No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted
No, don't be distracted

Stupid man
In the window
I couldn't be at rest
All my delight
All that mattered
I couldn't be at rest
From what I liked
From what I gathered
I couldn't be at rest
Stupid man
In the window
I couldn't be at rest

And don't be shy
In the window
Come down and give your best
Oh, delight
In the window
I couldn't be at rest
Stupid man
In the window
I couldn't be at rest
From what I liked
From what I gathered
I couldn't give my best

Oh, I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to breathe at all
Oh, I know it wasn't safe (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
It wasn't safe to breathe at all (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Oh, I know it wasn't safe (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
It wasn't safe to breathe at all (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Oh, I know it wasn't safe (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
It wasn't safe to speak at all (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)

Hold on, Suf, hold on, Suf, hold on, Sufjan (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Hold on, Suf, hold on, Suf, hold on, Sufjan (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Boy...

I never meant to cause you pain
My burden is the weight of a feather
I never meant to lead you on
I only meant to please me, however

And then you tell me, "Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together"

I'm nothing but a selfish man
I'm nothing but a privileged peddler
And did you think I'd stay the night?
And did you think I'd love you forever?

And then you tell me, "Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together"
I got to tell you, girl, I want nothing less
Girl, I want nothing less
Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure
Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure
I got to tell you, boy, we made such a mess
Boy, we made such a mess
Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together
Boy, we made such a mess together
