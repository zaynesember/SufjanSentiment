Peoria! Destroy-a!
Infinity! Divinity!

For Lydia, Octavia!
And Jack-of-Trades!
The Cubs hooray!

The Opera House
Where Emma sang!
America! Oh will it play?

And Santa Claus!
The Great Parade!
Peoria!
You have it made!

Into the crossfire
Faithfully run
Middle America
One on one
Peoria!
We saddle the fun times
