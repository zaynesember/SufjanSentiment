In the tower above the earth
There is a view that reaches far;
Where we see the universe
I see the fire, I see the end

Seven miles above the earth
There is Emmanuel of mothers
With His sword, with His robe
He comes dividing man from brothers

In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel
In the powers of the earth, we wait until He rails and rails.
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel
Oh, my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us

Still I go to the deepest grave
Where I go to sleep alone
