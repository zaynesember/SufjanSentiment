I called a name over the ocean
Lacrimal tears, fears of devotion

All the dreams I vowed to make come true
And the life I long to take I lose
Lord, why must this life be so cruel
When there ain't much you can do?

I saw your eyes burn in the moonlight
All I ask is a chance in this lifetime

All the dreams I vowed to make come true
And the life I long to take I lose
Lord, why must this life be so cruel
And shadowed in the gloom?
