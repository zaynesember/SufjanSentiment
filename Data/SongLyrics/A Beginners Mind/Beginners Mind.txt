Bodhi tree grows in the light
Shotgun shell, cannon fire
Baby, we've got nothing to lose
An ex-president, L.A sure has been changing
Living off the last of my loot

Hedonists in 909, trailer park, Columbine
Tina taken by FBI's
Uncut kilograms, two dead in the ambulance
Life was just a new way to die

Will you let yourself unwind
Put your soul on the line
Striving for a beginner's mind
My heart wasn't there
Couldn't be bothered to care
Now we're drowning in the moonlight

Oh my love, I can explain
I was only a child in search of my own name
A rider of thе storm
A mystic self-proclaimed
The glidеr of the air
A creature in its cage
Now won't you send me home
To my point break
