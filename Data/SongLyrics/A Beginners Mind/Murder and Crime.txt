Evidence known so long
Oh God, I'm lost in my wrongs
Everything froze like stone
Saw your heart couldn't take much more

My boy, I don't know why this life
Is so cruel and unkind, but it weighs on my heart
All joys were taken from your eyes
As the law would abide in murder and crime
Hard lines as the fossil defines
It's own shadow in lime and reveals how it dies

If anything goes, then everything's flawed
Oh my love, what the violence has caused
Malevolencе flowed from beyond
And my heart cannot takе much more

Oh joy I'm afraid of the light
As the jewel of my mind begins to fall apart
Do not destroy what has taken its time
As the lord would abide in murder and crime

Oh my love, I don't know why this life
Is so cruel and unkind but it weighs on my heart
Fading lines as the fossil denies
It's own shadow in the time to conceal how it died

Evidence known, march on
Oh God, I'm lost in the antiphon
Where does everything go when everything's gone?
For my heart cannot break much more
