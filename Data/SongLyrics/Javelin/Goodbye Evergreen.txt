Goodbye, Evergreen
You know I love you
But everything heaven sent
Must burn out in the end
I promised you
Just as you were in my dream
Now let me off easy
And I'll slip down through the drain
To release my scattered brain
My enemy

Something just isn't right
I cut from the inside
I'm frightened of the end
I'm drowning in my self-defense
Now punish me
Think of me as what you will
I grow like a cancer
I'm pressed out in thе rain
Deliver me from thе poisoned pain

Goodbye evergreen, goodbye evergreen
(Goodbye evergreen) Goodbye evergreen
You know I love you (You know I love you)
You know I love you
Goodbye evergreen (Goodbye evergreen)
Goodbye evergreen
You know I love you (You know I love you)
You know I love you
(Goodbye evergreen) Goodbye evergreen
You know I love you (You know I love you)
You know I love you
(Goodbye evergreen) Goodbye evergreen
You know I love you (You know I love you)
You know I love you
Goodbye evergreen (Goodbye evergreen)
Goodbye evergreen
(You know I love you)

You know I love you
You know I love you
You know I love
