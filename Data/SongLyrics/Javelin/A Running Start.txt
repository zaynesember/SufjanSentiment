If I imagine myself peaceful on the fire escape
Head first, my hands inside my T-shirt, as we run away
So now we have a running start
My body moves in mystic ways
I cross my arms to shield my heart
As everything turns into waves

I see the light upon the lake
The silver moon, the water snake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast

I know, I know the time has come to ask you for a kiss
Don't go, my lovely pantomime, receivе of me my only wish
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

If I align myself with Pisces in a funny way
Can you, my lovеr, kiss my bracelet, and my shoulder blades?
We’ve always had a running start
I jump between the trampolines
You throw your arms around my heart
As if to say you're all I need

The winter pines, the lonely drake
The light beneath the frozen lake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast

I know, I know the time has come to ask you for a kiss
Don't go, my lovely pantomime, receive of me my only wish
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
