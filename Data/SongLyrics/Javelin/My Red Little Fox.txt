I drink 'til it's lost
Drinking words within
That spin down Pentecost
Kiss me with the fire of gods
Just say what you want
Say it out within
Without that funny little cough
Simple minded, simple talk

Don't start with your camouflage
Spurning from within
Jump in, my red little fox
And rivers running through it all
So kiss me as I am lost
Kiss me from within
Jump in, my red little fox
Yellow paper folded off

My love, my queen, my broken
Dreams come save me
Kiss me like the wind
Now I sing it won't you
Kiss me from within
Now I sing it won't you
Kiss me like the wind
That flows within your veins

Let's not be for want
Wanting is a sin
I don't want anything at all
Yellow fever folded off
Let's drink 'til it's Pentеcost
Drink unto the wind
Jump in, my red little fox
Kiss mе with the fire of gods
Let's scream 'til it's all forgot
Screaming words within
That spin without any cost
Kiss me with the fire of gods

My love, my queen, my spoken
Dreams come save me
Kiss me like the wind
Now I sing it won't you
Kiss me from within
Now I sing it won't you
Kiss me like the wind
That flows within your veins
