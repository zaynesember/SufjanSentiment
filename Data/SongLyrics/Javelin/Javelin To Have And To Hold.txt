Searching through the snow
For the javelin I had not meant to throw right at you
For if it had hit its mark
There’d be blood in the place where you stood

It's a terrible thought to have and hold
It's a terrible thought to have and hold

So here we stand in the dark
My eyes travelling to the spot where you'd thrown yourself over the rocks
For if you'd not been so fast
There'd be blood in the place where you stood

It's a terrible thought to have and hold
It's a terriblе thought to have and hold
It's a terrible thought to havе and hold
