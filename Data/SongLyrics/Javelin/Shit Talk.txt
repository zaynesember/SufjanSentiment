No more fighting
No more talking shit
Do as I say, not as I give up
Not as I've failed to live
In the future there will be a terrible cost
For all that we've left undone
Deliver me from everything I've put off
And all that we've lost
I will always love you
But I cannot live with you

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I will always love you
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

No more fighting
I've nothing left to give
I've nothing but atrophy
Did I cross you?
Did I fail to believe in positive thoughts?
Our romantic second chance is dead
I buried it with the hatchet
Quit your antics
Put them at the foot of the bed
And set it, on fire
I will always love you
But I cannot look at you

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I will always love you
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I will always love you
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I will always love you

Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall

Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
(I will always love you)
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
(I will always love you)
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
