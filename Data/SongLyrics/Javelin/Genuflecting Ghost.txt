Give myself as a sacrifice
Genuflecting ghost I kiss the floor
Rise, my love, show me paradise
Nothing seems so simple anymore

Rest assured, words come easy
Insecure, love and please me
Sacred word, bind me, insult
As I praise your name

Now we dance in our catastrophe
Ramparts in the sky that flash with horror
Let's take these chances, no more amnesty
Nothing else remains as once before

Rest assured, empires will fall
Insecure, restless and small
Sacred word, bind me, insult
As I praise your name

Give myself as a sacrifice
Genuflecting ghost I kiss no more
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
