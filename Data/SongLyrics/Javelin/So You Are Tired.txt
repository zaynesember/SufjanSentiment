So you are tired of us
So rest your head
Turning back fourteen years
Of what I did and said

So you are breathing disaster
I did what I was told
But I was a man born invisible
Was it something I said or some kind of joke?

So you are tired as the sun
Are you with or without a friend?
Bring me back everything caught in your shield
Let everything else descend

So you are seething with laughter
Was it really all just a joke?
I was a man indivisible
When everything else was broke

Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah

So you are tired of evеn my kiss
So go back to your den
Throwing out everything lеft in your field
When there was nothing left to defend

So you are dreaming of after
Was it really all just for fun?
I was the man still in love with you
When I already knew it was done

Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah

So you are tired of me
So rest your head
Turning back all that we had in our life
While I return to death

Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh
