Can you lift me up to a higher place?
Forget everything that was before
Turn your face around like a salted sphere
Turn yourself around to see what once was there

Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises

Jesus lift me up to a higher plane (To a higher plane)
Can you come around before I go insane? (Before I go insane)
Cast me not in hell, while my demons rage (While my demons rage)
Turn yourself around to see what I can say (To see what I can say)

Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises

Turn yourself away from the wickedness I said
Evil comes to play in the image of the dead

Everything rises must converge
Everything rises in a word
Everything rises must converge
Everything rises

Everything rises (Everything rises)
Everything rises (Everything rises)
Everything rises (Everything rises)
Everything rises
