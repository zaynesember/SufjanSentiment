And the winter moves about Illinois
When my sister picks a fight with the Alexander boy
And my father locks the car by the store
Still, we figure out the keys and follow him once more

Oh my God, we see it on the floor
The woman on the bed, the ankle brace she wore
Stones and sled, it could have been some other
The mind that knows itself has a mind to serve the other
But we run back, scratching at the door
Scratching at the door

If I'm hiding in the sleeves of my coat
When my father runs undressed, he's pointing at my throat
And my brother has a fit in the snow
And the traffic stops for miles, we take him by the elbow

Oh my God (oh my God), the shuffling at the floor (no one came)
A mind that knows itself (to our side) is a mind that knows much more (to carry us away from danger)
So we run back (oh my God), scrambling for cover (no one came)
A mind that knows (to our side) itself has a mind to kill the other (to carry us away from danger)

Oh my God
You left us now for dead
You left us now for dead
