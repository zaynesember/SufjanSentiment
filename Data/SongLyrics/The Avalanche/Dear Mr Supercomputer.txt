(Sound the horn
Make the bed
Pull the cord
Raise the dead)

Oh my God, I can't believe it
What went wrong?
The human race in its place
Superstition, man's religion
And conditioned
Mysteries incomplete

And the raven with its haven
Gods ingraven
Girls and boys, Illinois
Springfield with its freak and banter
Strike the cantor
God is dead, God is dead
Oh my God, I can't believe it
What went wrong?
The human race in its place
In religion, superstition
Man's conditioned
Mysteries incomplete

Superman, old machines
Kind as that, Energenes
Good as dead, man-machines
Computer, effigy
Sound the horn, make the bed
Pull the cord, raise the dead
In my car, on this street
On this earth, on this feet

Take it for a patient man I caught it
Patient is the kind that gets you paid
Even if I had it, man, I got it
Seems I never had it anyway
Sometimes it may seem your best intentions
Take off with a fever anyway

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All computers go to heaven
If you think you got the vision
Put it to the conversation
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All computers go to heaven
If you think you got the vision
Put it to the conversation
I rejoice in what I carry in my heart
It overwhelms, what a man
Great Emancipation plans
And public transit
Clap your hands, Abraham
Oh, religion, superstition
Man's conditioned
Mysteries incomplete
Oh, the raven with its haven
Gods ingraven
All is dead, all is dead
