What's the worth of
All the work of my hands?
And the worst of
On Lake Michigan

Get in solid walls
With the know-it-alls
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow

Get in solid walls
With the know-it-alls
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow

And my good friends
With their eyes on what it takes
I could kiss them
But the bravest make mistakes

Get in solid walls
With the know-it-alls
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow

Get in solid walls
With the know-it-alls
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow

Get in solid walls
And with what it calls
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow

Get in solid walls
With the know-it-alls
Get in trouble with Saul Bellow
