I woke up in stereo—I spent the day in vertigo
I could not get the spirit off my back
Put my feelings on the table
Eat my heart out if you're able
Separate the fever from the fact
So much for the afterglow
I feel just like an embryo
I take it out before you put it back
Put my head between my knees
I search myself for all disease
I separate the bottle from the cap

Is it all for something? Is it all part of a plan?
Tranquilize me, sanitize me, Ativan
(Ativan, my leading woman)
Is it all for nothing? Is it all part of a plan?
Make my wish list, mind my business
Do the best I can (with what I am)

Caught up in the baby's breath
I shit my pants and wet the bed
It takes some time to throw the demons off
Put the lotion in the basket
Now jump off the overpass
It takes some time before the skin comes off
Fill me with the blood of Jesus
Clean my plate 'til he receives us
Separate the colors from the black
Shut the shades to make it prosper
Cut your face to make it softer
Tell the shadows near us to come back

Is it all for nothing? Is it all part of a plan?
Tranquilize me and revise me, Ativan
(Ativan, my leading woman)
Is it all full circle? Is it all part of a plan?
Make my death wish, mind my business
I'm doing the best I can (with what I am)
Is it all for nothing? (All for nothing)
Is it all part of a plan? (All part of a plan)
Tranquilize me and revise me, Ativan
(Ativan, my leading woman)
Is it all full circle? (All full circle)
Is it all part of a plan? (All part of a plan)
Make my death wish, mind my business
I'm doing the best I can with what I am (with what I am)
