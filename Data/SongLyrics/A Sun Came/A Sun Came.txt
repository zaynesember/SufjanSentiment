Everything you are
Is everything we have
You're the only good thing
A sun came
Burned our faces round
Burned our faces red
You are still the rage, a rock
From the enemy
There is still a house, a cage
For the enemy
When my friends turned out, I found out
There is still a Lord
But I never felt so lonely
A sun came
