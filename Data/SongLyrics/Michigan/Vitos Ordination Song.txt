I always knew you
In your mother's arms
I have called your name
I've an idea
Placed in your mind

To be a better man
I've made a crown for you
Put it in your room

And when the bridegroom comes
There will be noise
There will be glad

And a perfect bed

And when you write a poem
I know the words
I know the sounds
Before you write it down
When you wear your clothes
I wear them too
I wear your shoes

And your jacket too
I always knew you
In your mother's arms

I have called you son
I've made amends
Between father and son

Or if you haven't one

Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said

Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said

Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said
