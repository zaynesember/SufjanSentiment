If you happen to be educated
Time it marches on
Oh time it marches on
If the end there is a sacred show
Delivers every song
Delivers every song

Mourning steps and
Mourning gallivants
And mourning never shows
No mourning never slows
If the avatar reminds that it
Will never stand at all
Will never stand as tall

Since the water made it
Most to sail it
Made it most to song
It made it most to song
For the politics are not political
For what they stand
For not what they demand
Every senator and diplomat
Combines her certain part
A matter for the heart
Save yourself from recognition
Selflessness and quiet song
To better get along

(We love you. We chose to
We made to. We love you.)

If we concentrate and pull
Resources to the highest poll
To beat the highest pull, too
Ever we will conquer grief
And find it faster to resolve
The dead, to be absolved
And fed, to restore
If the advantageous
Reprimand misgivings
We won't grow
We will not ever know
We will not!
(Lift my life in healthy places!)
