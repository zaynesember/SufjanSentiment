I was the best man in a size too small
You were my best friend, going at it all
What if I put off my inheritance?
Where is the best man?
All arise us all in peace

I still know you
And I still like you, the best man
I still owe you

Everything rises, going at it all
All the surprises in a size too small
And what if I told you
I was still in love with this?
Would you surprise us
In a size for all of me?

I still know you
And I still like you, the best man
I still know you, the best man
I still owe you
