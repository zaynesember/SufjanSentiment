I can see a lot of life in you
I can see a lot of bright in you
And I think the dress looks nice on you
I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a bed and make it too
I can see a fireside turn blue
I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

When the world looks back
When the face looks after that
I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a lot of life in you
I can see a bed and make it too
And I think the dress looks nice on you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you
I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you
