Up in the highest of heights
O'Hara blinks and fights
This land is yours, this land is mine
I see the Captain in red
And Cairo at his head
This land is yours, this land is mine

The lightning over the park
The waters, brash and dark
We take a swim, we take a swim
I never meant to escape
The carpet and the trade
This land is yours, this land is mine

And when I make up my mind
I change it all the time
I take it back, I take it back
The numbers over the dam
Jo Davies and the band
I count them out, I count them out

There was a car in the bay
By the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
In the water that we made
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out
To the floor

The ferry hatches Moline
Panola Beauty Queen
She takes a bow, she takes a bow
In Charles, we climb the hill
And Danville window sill
I take it back, I take it back

My sister she counts the bars
The Macon county cars
She takes a bow, she takes a bow
The Mississippi amends
The Carver and the bends
This land is yours, this land is mine

(This land is not your land
For the right hand takes what it can
Ransacks with the madman)

My brother punches my ear
The injured ivory deer
I call my dad, I call my dad
We skip inside of the store
The Mason winter door
This land is yours, this land is mine
(For this land is not yours or mine to have
This land was made for the good of itself)

There was a car in the bay
By the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
In the water that we made
I'm holding your hand by the shore
With our collars pulled up tight
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out

(This land is not your land
For the right hand takes what it can
Ransacks with the madman
For this land is not yours or mine to have
This land was made for the good of itself)
