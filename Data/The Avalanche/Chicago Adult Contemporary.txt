I fell in love again
All things go, all things go
Drove to Chicago
All things know, all things know
We sold our clothes to the state
I don't mind, I don't mind
I made a lot of mistakes
In my mind, in my mind

I drove to New York
In the van, with my friend
We slept in parking lots
I don't mind, I don't mind
I was in love with the place
In my mind, in my mind
I made a lot of mistakes
In my mind, in my mind

You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow
We had our mindset
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go

If I was crying
In the van, with my friend
It was for freedom
From myself and from the land
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes

You came to take us
All things go, all things go (If I was right or wrong I..)
To recreate us (..can't admit)
All things grow, all things grow (Running away from things I..)
We had our mindset (..can't resist)
All things know, all things know (Show what we all can't see yet)
You had to find it (Blind and deaf)
All things go, all things go

You came to take us (Chasing this)
All things go, all things go (If I was right or wrong I)
To recreate us (Can't admit)
All things grow, all things grow (Along the way the things I)
We had our mindset (Can't resist)
(I made a lot of mistakes)
All things know, all things know (Showing what I can't see yet)
(I made a lot of mistakes)
You had to find it (Blind and deaf)
(I made a lot of mistakes)
All things go, all things go
(I made a lot of mistakes)
