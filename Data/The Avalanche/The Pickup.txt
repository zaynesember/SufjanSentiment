All things past in the pick-up
Found my brother's badge
Abraham is live and well in the pick-up
And his wife cast no more spells in the pick-up

Found myself in the pick-up
Seat belt on my lap
And my sister with her braids
In the pick-up

Kissed my mother on the face
In the pick-up
Clapping with the human race
In the pick-up
