Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror
From the park when Dakota ran and brought you there
In the car when your mother lost her temper
The catalog and the catastrophic smile

Let the bugles play
The sermon on the raid
I kissed you on the face
I kissed you on the playground

Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What’s right and wrong
You cannot tell me
I'll jump before I get around you
Oh Father John

Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway
(Don’t give up, let's go, forget about yourself)
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway
Forget about yourself and all your plans

Oh life, with your colorful surprises
Eleanor, how you put one on disguises

Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What’s right and wrong
You cannot tell me

In the mortal life
Far in the morning light
We’re back from Bloomington
We let the runners win
Far in the morning life
We let the movies play
A weekend from the holiday

Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway
(Don’t break down, let’s go: forget about yourself)
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway
(If I’m wrong makes nothing right about yourself)

Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around
Forget about yourself and all your plans
