My love, I've lost my faith in everything
Tell me you love me anyway, tell me you love me anyway
(Tell me you love me)
My love, I feel myself unravelling
Tell me you love me anyway, tell me you love me anyway
(Tell me you love me)
My love, I feel the darkness on my back
Something inside me like a wave (Something inside me)
Something inside me like a wave (Something inside me like a wave)
(Tell me you love me)

(My love) Right now, I could use a change of heart
(My love) Or a kiss before everything falls apart
(My love) Can you tell me this love will last forever?
(Tell me you love me)
(My love) As the world turns, making such a mess
(My love) What's the point of it when everything's dispossessed?
(My love) Can we carry this love across the desert?
(Tell me you love me)

My love, I wish I was a photograph (Photograph)
Perfect and lovely in a frame (Perfect and lovely)
Perfect and lovely in a frame (Perfect and lovely in a frame)
(Tell me you love me)
My love, my life could be an epitaph
Something to write upon my grave (Something to write)
Something to write upon my grave (Something to write upon my grave)
(Tell me you love me)

(My love) Right now, I could use a change of plans
(My love) When it all falls, what's the use of open hands?
(My love) Can you tell me this love will last forever?
(Tell me you love me)
(My love) And as the world burns, breathing in the blight
(My love) What's the point of it if morning turns into night?
(My love) Can we carry this love? It's now or never

(I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you every day
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you every day
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you every day
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you every day
I'm gonna love you every day
I'm gonna love you
