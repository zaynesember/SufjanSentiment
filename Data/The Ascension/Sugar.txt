Is someone gonna cut me some slack?
Now that it’s a quarter to ten
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
You tell me that you wanna fall back
But I don’t wanna do this again
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

You stand up straight, now stand real tall
And wipe that writing off the wall
This is the right time
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Now put one foot in front of the other
Take a breath, now breathe, my lover
Let’s take up this lifeline
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Is that the weight of the world on your back?
Surrender with that colorful flag
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Yeah, they’ve been selling us this fiction as fact
But I don’t wanna lose you again
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Don’t make me wait (Don’t make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait (Don’t make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

All the shit they try to feed us
Don’t drink the poison or they’ll defeat us
This is the right time
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t break my heart, don’t break my flow now
And all this rage has got to go now
Let’s take up this lifeline
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Don’t make me wait (Don’t make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait (Don’t make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Don’t make me wait (Don't make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait (Don't make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Don’t make me wait
Don’t make me wait too long
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait
Don’t make me wait too long
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Don’t make me wait
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
