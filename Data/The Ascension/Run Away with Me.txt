And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling remedy
Come run away with me
And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling fantasy
Come run away with me
And I say, love

[Verse 1]
They will terrorize us
With new confusion
With the fear of life that seeks to bring despair within
And they will paralyze us
With new illusions
Let the dead revive the beast within

And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling remedy
Come run away with me
And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling fantasy
Come run away with me
And I say, love

And I will bring you life
A new communion
With a paradise that brings the truth of light within
And I will show you rapture
A new horizon
Follow me to life and love within

And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling remedy
Come run away with me
And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling fantasy
Come run away with me

And I say, love
Come run away with me
You're all I ever need
Come run away
And I say, love
Come run away with me
You're all I ever need
Come run away
And I say, love
