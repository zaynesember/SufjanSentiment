I don’t wanna be your personal Jesus
I don’t wanna live inside of that flame
In a way I wanna be my own believer
I don’t wanna play your video game
I don’t wanna be the center of the universe
I don’t wanna be a part of that shame
In a way, I wanna be my own redeemer
I don’t wanna play your video game

I don’t care if everybody else is into it
I don’t care if it’s a popular refrain
I don’t wanna be a puppet in a theater
I don’t wanna play your video game
You don’t wanna be the one who has to pay for it
You don’t wanna be the one who has to change
All you want is what the resumé tells you
I don’t wanna play your video game

I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I just wanna go away)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game

I don’t wanna love you if won’t receive it
I don’t wanna save the world that way
I don’t wanna be your personal Jesus
I don’t wanna play your video game
I don’t wanna put the devil on a pedestal
I don’t wanna put the saints in chains
I just wanna make my life a little easier
I don’t wanna play your video game

I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
(I just wanna go away)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
(I just wanna go away)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
(I just wanna go away)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
[Bridge]
I don’t wanna be your Julius Caesar
I don’t want it to go down that way
But in a way you gotta follow the procedure
So go ahead and play your video game

I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
(I just wanna go away)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
(I just wanna go away)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
(I just wanna go away)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
