(I'm your ticket tonight)

Death star into space
Trash talk, violate it
What you call the human race
Go on, wipe that look off your face
Death star into space
Trash talk, violate it
Witness me resist the hate
It’s your own damn head on that plate

(I'm your ticket tonight)

Death star into space
Vandalize what you create
Trash talk, violate it
Go on, wipe that look off your face
Death star into space
What you call the human race
Expedite the judgement day (I'm your ticket tonight)
It's your own damn head on that plate

(I'm your ticket tonight)
(I'm your ticket tonight)

Death star into space
Watch me now and take the bait
Battle star, cannot fake it
Go on, let the future deflate
Death star into space
What you call the human race
Witness me, resist the hate (I'm your ticket tonight)
It's your own damn head on that plate

Death star into space
Trash talk, violate it
Vandalize what you create
It's your own damn head on that plate
Death star into space
What you call the human race
Witness me resist your fate (I'm your ticket tonight)
It’s your own damn head on that plate

(I'm your ticket tonight)
(I'm your ticket tonight)
(I'm your ticket tonight)
