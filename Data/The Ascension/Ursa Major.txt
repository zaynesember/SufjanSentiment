For the love of God
In the shade of Ursa Major
For the life of me
I can't account for human nature
For your information
I'm not one for controversy
So I ask forgiveness now
Lord, reveal yourself in mercy
Call off all emergency
And look at things the way I see them
For the beauty of the Earth
It shows us wisdom, love, and rebirth

I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
Until the earth runs through it
I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
And I'm definitely gonna do it

For the love of mercy
In the face of all this danger
For the most of all my life
I feel as if I were a stranger
And all the consequences
From the throes of our persuasion
Lord, I ask for patience now
Call off all of your invasion
There's is beauty where I see it
Everywhere that I can feel it
I am on the verge of sorrow
Tell me, Lord, which road to follow

I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
Until the earth runs through it
I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
And I'm definitely gonna do it

I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
Until the earth runs through it
I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
And I'm definitely gonna do it
