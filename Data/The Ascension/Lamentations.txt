Take me into all of your life
I am the future, define the future
I was only thinking of human kindness
I am the future, define the future
I have always wanted to be here with you
Love me the first time, love me the last time
Something that I wanted to see through with you
I am the future, define the future

Is this the way you make me ask for something more?
Is this the reason why you walk back to the door?
You wanna rebel but you hold yourself indecision
And something tells me that you gave it all up over division

Take me into all of your lifetime
I am the future, define the future
Take me into all of your lasting lifetime
I am the future, define the future
I was only thinking of human kindness
Love me the first time, love me the last time
Take me into all of your lamentations
I am the future, define the future
