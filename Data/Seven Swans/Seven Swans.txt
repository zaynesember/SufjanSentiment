We didn't sleep too late
There was a fire in the yard
All of the trees were in light
They had no faces to show
I saw a sign in the sky
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans
I heard a voice in my mind
"I will try, I will try, I will try
I will try, I will try, I will try"

We saw the dragon move down
My father burned into coal
My mother saw it from afar
She took her purse to the bed
I saw a sign in the sky
Seven horns, seven horns, seven horns
I heard a voice in my mind
"I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord"
He said, "I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord"
He said, "I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord"

He will take you
If you run
He will chase you
He will take you
If you run
He will chase you
Because He is the Lord
Cause He is the Lord
Cause He is the Lord
Cause He is the Lord
[Collision]
Cause He is the Lord
(Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans)
Cause He is the Lord
(Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans)
Cause He is the Lord
(Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans)
