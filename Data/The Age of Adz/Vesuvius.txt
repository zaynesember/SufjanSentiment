Vesuvius
I am here
You are all I have
Fire of fire
I'm insecure
For it is all been made to plan

Though I know
I will fail
I cannot be made to laugh
For in life
As in death
I'd rather be burned than be living in debt

Vesuvius
Are you a ghost
Or the symbols of light or a fantasy host?
In your breast
I carry the form
The heart of the Earth and the weapons of warmth

Vesuvius
The tragic oath
For you have destroyed with the elegant smoke
Oracle, I've fallen at last
But they were the feast of a permanent blast

Vesuvius
Oh, be kind
It hasn't occurred, no, it hasn't been said
Sufjan
Follow the path
It leads to an article of imminent death

Sufjan
Follow your heart
Follow the flame or fall on the floor
Sufjan
The panic inside
The murdering ghost that you cannot ignore

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the ghost
Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the host
Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the ghost
Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor your host

Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the ghost
Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the ghost
Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the ghost
Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now as I favor the ghost

Follow me now
Or follow your death
Why does it have to be so hard?
It's in your favor
Follow me now
Or follow your death
It's in your favor
Why does it have to be so hard?
It's in your favor
Follow me now
Or follow your death
It's in your favor
Why does it have to be so hard?
It's in your favor
