I slept for five days
In stillness I laid full of demonic visions
My still life remains like the path of a pigeon
That flew into flames from the rivals of Hell

Raised from the dead to save my soul
J.P. Monroe tied up his ghost
Life was just like a camera show
Captured in song my life gives blood

It's all flesh in my mind
I can’t wait to inscribe
All the names that I've read in the blood of your knife
Heaven and Hell await all who give of their life
I've been waiting this time

Now covered in chains (now covered in chains)
My skin is ablated with bleeding incision
And still, life remains, my cadaver imprisoned
As you shall retain me and raise me from Hell

Cenobite seized within the throes
To be released from the Pillar of Souls
Dragged from the dark, my love extolled
Bring me the beast, my life gives blood

It’s all flesh in my mind
I can't wait to describe
All the dead that I've raised with the blood of your knife
Heaven help me await all who give of their life
Drink the blood of my wine

Drink the blood of my wine
Drink the blood of my wine
