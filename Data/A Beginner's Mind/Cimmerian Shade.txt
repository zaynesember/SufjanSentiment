The lamb cries 'til ears ring
I cannot love from my prison of shame
In Cimmerian Shade
Iâ€™ll keep her safe in the well, tailor made

I just want you to love me
I just wanted to know myself
Fix it all, Jonathan Demme
Beauty resides where your spirit dwells

My Starling flies into the rainbow
Lost in the mist, chrysalis, kill your idols
Safe in my Autogynephilia
One black witch moth, now she's lost in the meadow

I just want you to love me
I just wanted to change myself
Fix it all, Jonathan Demme
Beauty resides where your spirit dwells

I just want you to love me (I just want you to love me)
I just wanted to change myself
Fix it all, Jonathan Demme (Fix it all, Jonathan Demme)
Beauty resides where your spirit dwells

Save me from everything I ask for
Soil from the sod, lamb of God, rest in peace
I'm still just running from the answer
Safe in the cell, kiss and tell, my Clarice

I just want you to love me
I just wanted to love myself
Fix it all, Jonathan Demme
Beauty resides where your spirit dwells

I just want you to love me (I just want you to love me)
I just wanted to love myself
Fix it all, Jonathan Demme (Fix it all, Jonathan Demme)
Beauty resides where your spirit dwells

I just want you to love me
I just want you to love me
(I just wanted to love myself)
I just want you to love me
I just want you to love me
(I just wanted to love myself)
I just want you to love me
(I just wanted to love myself)
