A voice of air's mellifluence
Draconian will, superstition
Now go arise, awake your dead
An angel fell, one heaven sent

The Beaufort scale measured the gales
I saw the world between two sails
The water climbed over the sky
As miracles demystify

All that was lost in the world
Yeah I've been lost in the world
How do we all make it through?
Caught in thought, daydreaming like I do
Just like you, when you told me all your dreams would comе true
Well I hope you'rе right, and they always do

An optical indifference
Parallel realms of existence
Cosmologies, apocalypse
Your premonition's persistence

For all that was lost in the world
Yeah I've been lost in the world
How will we all make it through?
Caught in thoughts, daydreaming like I do
Just like you, when you told me all your dreams would come true
Well I hope you're right, and they always do
