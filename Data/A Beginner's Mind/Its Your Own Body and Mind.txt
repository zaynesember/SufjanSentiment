Shall we all talk paternal?
Shall we all talk of the sun?
Everything runs in circles
Everything comes undone
One hand holds the mantle
The other one holds the key
Your body is a sanctuary
And your body is about to be free

She's gotta have it
She’s got a dream (She's got a dream)
And she'll make it a habit of doing her own thing
She’s doing her own thing

Doesn't it seem quite obvious?
Doesn't it seem unwise?
Nothing else can be taken from you
It's your own body and mind
One hand holds the candle
The other onе holds the flame
Infinite with its guiding light
Illuminating all things thе same

She's gotta have it
She's got a dream (She's got a dream)
And she'll make it a habit of doing her own thing
She’s doing her own thing
