I have called you children, I have called you son
What is there to answer if I'm the only one?
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Still I must obey, still I must invite

If there's anything to say
If there's anything to do
If there's any other way
I'll do anything for you

I was dressed embarrassment, I was dressed in wine
If you had a part of me, will you take your time?
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life?

Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If we ever make a mess
I'll do anything for you

I have called you preacher, I have called you son
If you have a father, or if you haven't one
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you

I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
