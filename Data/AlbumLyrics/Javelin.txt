If I imagine myself peaceful on the fire escape
Head first, my hands inside my T-shirt, as we run away
So now we have a running start
My body moves in mystic ways
I cross my arms to shield my heart
As everything turns into waves

I see the light upon the lake
The silver moon, the water snake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast

I know, I know the time has come to ask you for a kiss
Don't go, my lovely pantomime, receivе of me my only wish
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

If I align myself with Pisces in a funny way
Can you, my lovеr, kiss my bracelet, and my shoulder blades?
We’ve always had a running start
I jump between the trampolines
You throw your arms around my heart
As if to say you're all I need

The winter pines, the lonely drake
The light beneath the frozen lake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast

I know, I know the time has come to ask you for a kiss
Don't go, my lovely pantomime, receive of me my only wish
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Can you lift me up to a higher place?
Forget everything that was before
Turn your face around like a salted sphere
Turn yourself around to see what once was there

Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises

Jesus lift me up to a higher plane (To a higher plane)
Can you come around before I go insane? (Before I go insane)
Cast me not in hell, while my demons rage (While my demons rage)
Turn yourself around to see what I can say (To see what I can say)

Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises

Turn yourself away from the wickedness I said
Evil comes to play in the image of the dead

Everything rises must converge
Everything rises in a word
Everything rises must converge
Everything rises

Everything rises (Everything rises)
Everything rises (Everything rises)
Everything rises (Everything rises)
Everything rises

Give myself as a sacrifice
Genuflecting ghost I kiss the floor
Rise, my love, show me paradise
Nothing seems so simple anymore

Rest assured, words come easy
Insecure, love and please me
Sacred word, bind me, insult
As I praise your name

Now we dance in our catastrophe
Ramparts in the sky that flash with horror
Let's take these chances, no more amnesty
Nothing else remains as once before

Rest assured, empires will fall
Insecure, restless and small
Sacred word, bind me, insult
As I praise your name

Give myself as a sacrifice
Genuflecting ghost I kiss no more
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Goodbye, Evergreen
You know I love you
But everything heaven sent
Must burn out in the end
I promised you
Just as you were in my dream
Now let me off easy
And I'll slip down through the drain
To release my scattered brain
My enemy

Something just isn't right
I cut from the inside
I'm frightened of the end
I'm drowning in my self-defense
Now punish me
Think of me as what you will
I grow like a cancer
I'm pressed out in thе rain
Deliver me from thе poisoned pain

Goodbye evergreen, goodbye evergreen
(Goodbye evergreen) Goodbye evergreen
You know I love you (You know I love you)
You know I love you
Goodbye evergreen (Goodbye evergreen)
Goodbye evergreen
You know I love you (You know I love you)
You know I love you
(Goodbye evergreen) Goodbye evergreen
You know I love you (You know I love you)
You know I love you
(Goodbye evergreen) Goodbye evergreen
You know I love you (You know I love you)
You know I love you
Goodbye evergreen (Goodbye evergreen)
Goodbye evergreen
(You know I love you)

You know I love you
You know I love you
You know I love

Searching through the snow
For the javelin I had not meant to throw right at you
For if it had hit its mark
There’d be blood in the place where you stood

It's a terrible thought to have and hold
It's a terrible thought to have and hold

So here we stand in the dark
My eyes travelling to the spot where you'd thrown yourself over the rocks
For if you'd not been so fast
There'd be blood in the place where you stood

It's a terrible thought to have and hold
It's a terriblе thought to have and hold
It's a terrible thought to havе and hold

I drink 'til it's lost
Drinking words within
That spin down Pentecost
Kiss me with the fire of gods
Just say what you want
Say it out within
Without that funny little cough
Simple minded, simple talk

Don't start with your camouflage
Spurning from within
Jump in, my red little fox
And rivers running through it all
So kiss me as I am lost
Kiss me from within
Jump in, my red little fox
Yellow paper folded off

My love, my queen, my broken
Dreams come save me
Kiss me like the wind
Now I sing it won't you
Kiss me from within
Now I sing it won't you
Kiss me like the wind
That flows within your veins

Let's not be for want
Wanting is a sin
I don't want anything at all
Yellow fever folded off
Let's drink 'til it's Pentеcost
Drink unto the wind
Jump in, my red little fox
Kiss mе with the fire of gods
Let's scream 'til it's all forgot
Screaming words within
That spin without any cost
Kiss me with the fire of gods

My love, my queen, my spoken
Dreams come save me
Kiss me like the wind
Now I sing it won't you
Kiss me from within
Now I sing it won't you
Kiss me like the wind
That flows within your veins

No more fighting
No more talking shit
Do as I say, not as I give up
Not as I've failed to live
In the future there will be a terrible cost
For all that we've left undone
Deliver me from everything I've put off
And all that we've lost
I will always love you
But I cannot live with you

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I will always love you
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

No more fighting
I've nothing left to give
I've nothing but atrophy
Did I cross you?
Did I fail to believe in positive thoughts?
Our romantic second chance is dead
I buried it with the hatchet
Quit your antics
Put them at the foot of the bed
And set it, on fire
I will always love you
But I cannot look at you

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I will always love you
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I will always love you
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I will always love you

Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall

Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
(I will always love you)
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall
(I will always love you)
Hold me closely
Hold me tightly, lest I fall

So you are tired of us
So rest your head
Turning back fourteen years
Of what I did and said

So you are breathing disaster
I did what I was told
But I was a man born invisible
Was it something I said or some kind of joke?

So you are tired as the sun
Are you with or without a friend?
Bring me back everything caught in your shield
Let everything else descend

So you are seething with laughter
Was it really all just a joke?
I was a man indivisible
When everything else was broke

Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah

So you are tired of evеn my kiss
So go back to your den
Throwing out everything lеft in your field
When there was nothing left to defend

So you are dreaming of after
Was it really all just for fun?
I was the man still in love with you
When I already knew it was done

Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah

So you are tired of me
So rest your head
Turning back all that we had in our life
While I return to death

Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh

There's a world you’re living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow real hard

Look around it, have you found it
Walking down the avenue?
See what it brings, could be good things
In the air for me and you

We are leaving (We are leaving), we are gone (We are gone)
Come with us to all alone
Never worry (Never worry), never moan (Never moan)
We will leave you all alone

In the mountains (In the mountains), in the cities (In the cities)
You can see the righteous dream
Look around you (Look around you), has it found you? (Has it found you?)
Is it what it really seems?

There's a world you’re (There's a world you're) living in (Living in)
No one else has your part
All God's children (All God's children) in the wind (In the wind)
Take it in and blow real hard

Ooh
Aah, ah-ah-ah
Ooh
Aah, ah-ah-ah

Chase away my heart and heartache
Run me over, throw me over, cast me out
Find a river running to the west wind
Just above the shoreline you will see a cloud

Tie me to a tiny wooden raft
Burn my body, point me to the undertow
Push me off into the void at last
Watch me drift and watch me struggle, let me go
'Cause I really wanna know

Will anybody ever love me? (Love me)
For good reasons
Without grievance, not for sport
Will anybody ever love me? (Love me)
In every season
Pledge allegiance to my heart
Pledge allegiance to my burning heart

Hello, wildness, please forgive me now
For the heartache and the misery I create
Take my suffering as I take my vow
Wash me now, anoint me with that golden blade

Tie me to the final wooden stake (Oh, ooh-ooh)
Burn my body, celebrate the afterglow (Afterglow)
Wash away the summer sins I made (Oh, ooh-ooh)
Watch me drift and watch me struggle, let me go (Let me go)
'Cause I really wanna know

Will anybody ever love me? (Love me)
For good reasons
Without grievance, not for sport (Not for sport)
Will anybody ever love me? (Love me)
In every season
Pledge allegiance to my heart (To my heart)
In every season
Pledge allegiance to my heart (To my heart)

My burning heart
My burning heart
My burning heart
(Will anybody ever love me? Love me)
My burning heart
(Will anybody ever love me? Love me)
My burning heart
(Will anybody ever love me? Love me)
My burning heart
