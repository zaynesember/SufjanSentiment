Move me
Move like the waters I cannot drink
I have lost my patience
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move through to me
Show me the face of all of my dreams
Was it all for nothing?
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move through to me
Move like the ghost of a hazardous demon
Was it all forgiven?
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move like a centipede
Foolish as I am, follow my lead
I have lost my preference
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move through to me
Show me the face of the radical dream
There's no time for innocence
Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Shall you refuse me? (Shall you refuse me?)
Show me the face of the radical dream
There's no time for severance
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
Shall you abuse me? (Shall you abuse me?)
Show me the grace of a natural king
Lord, I need deliverance
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)
(Cannot refuse, cannot refuse)

And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling remedy
Come run away with me
And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling fantasy
Come run away with me
And I say, love


They will terrorize us
With new confusion
With the fear of life that seeks to bring despair within
And they will paralyze us
With new illusions
Let the dead revive the beast within


And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling remedy
Come run away with me
And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling fantasy
Come run away with me
And I say, love

And I will bring you life
A new communion
With a paradise that brings the truth of light within
And I will show you rapture
A new horizon
Follow me to life and love within


And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling remedy
Come run away with me
And I say, love
Come run away with me
Sweet falling fantasy
Come run away with me


And I say, love
Come run away with me
You're all I ever need
Come run away
And I say, love
Come run away with me
You're all I ever need
Come run away
And I say, love

I don’t wanna be your personal Jesus
I don’t wanna live inside of that flame
In a way I wanna be my own believer
I don’t wanna play your video game
I don’t wanna be the center of the universe
I don’t wanna be a part of that shame
In a way, I wanna be my own redeemer
I don’t wanna play your video game


I don’t care if everybody else is into it
I don’t care if it’s a popular refrain
I don’t wanna be a puppet in a theater
I don’t wanna play your video game
You don’t wanna be the one who has to pay for it
You don’t wanna be the one who has to change
All you want is what the resumé tells you
I don’t wanna play your video game


I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I just wanna go away)

(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game

I don’t wanna love you if won’t receive it
I don’t wanna save the world that way
I don’t wanna be your personal Jesus
I don’t wanna play your video game
I don’t wanna put the devil on a pedestal
I don’t wanna put the saints in chains
I just wanna make my life a little easier
I don’t wanna play your video game


I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
(I just wanna go away)

I don't wanna play your video game

I don’t wanna be your Julius Caesar
I don’t want it to go down that way
But in a way you gotta follow the procedure
So go ahead and play your video game


I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play
(I don't wanna play)
I don't wanna play your video game
(I just wanna go away)
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play

Take me into all of your life
I am the future, define the future
I was only thinking of human kindness
I am the future, define the future
I have always wanted to be here with you
Love me the first time, love me the last time
Something that I wanted to see through with you
I am the future, define the future


Is this the way you make me ask for something more?
Is this the reason why you walk back to the door?
You wanna rebel but you hold yourself indecision
And something tells me that you gave it all up over division


Take me into all of your lifetime
I am the future, define the future
Take me into all of your lasting lifetime
I am the future, define the future
I was only thinking of human kindness
Love me the first time, love me the last time
Take me into all of your lamentations
I am the future, define the future
My love, I've lost my faith in everything
Tell me you love me anyway, tell me you love me anyway
(Tell me you love me)
My love, I feel myself unravelling
Tell me you love me anyway, tell me you love me anyway
(Tell me you love me)
My love, I feel the darkness on my back
Something inside me like a wave (Something inside me)
Something inside me like a wave (Something inside me like a wave)
(Tell me you love me)

(My love) Right now, I could use a change of heart
(My love) Or a kiss before everything falls apart
(My love) Can you tell me this love will last forever?
(Tell me you love me)
(My love) As the world turns, making such a mess
(My love) What's the point of it when everything's dispossessed?
(My love) Can we carry this love across the desert?
(Tell me you love me)

My love, I wish I was a photograph (Photograph)
Perfect and lovely in a frame (Perfect and lovely)
Perfect and lovely in a frame (Perfect and lovely in a frame)
(Tell me you love me)
My love, my life could be an epitaph
Something to write upon my grave (Something to write)
Something to write upon my grave (Something to write upon my grave)
(Tell me you love me)
(My love) Right now, I could use a change of plans
(My love) When it all falls, what's the use of open hands?
(My love) Can you tell me this love will last forever?
(Tell me you love me)
(My love) And as the world burns, breathing in the blight
(My love) What's the point of it if morning turns into night?
(My love) Can we carry this love? It's now or never

(I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you every day
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you every day

I woke up in stereo—I spent the day in vertigo
I could not get the spirit off my back
Put my feelings on the table
Eat my heart out if you're able
Separate the fever from the fact
So much for the afterglow
I feel just like an embryo
I take it out before you put it back
Put my head between my knees
I search myself for all disease
I separate the bottle from the cap


Is it all for something? Is it all part of a plan?
Tranquilize me, sanitize me, Ativan
(Ativan, my leading woman)
Is it all for nothing? Is it all part of a plan?
Make my wish list, mind my business
Do the best I can (with what I am)


Caught up in the baby's breath
I shit my pants and wet the bed
It takes some time to throw the demons off
Put the lotion in the basket
Now jump off the overpass
It takes some time before the skin comes off
Fill me with the blood of Jesus
Clean my plate 'til he receives us
Separate the colors from the black
Shut the shades to make it prosper
Cut your face to make it softer
Tell the shadows near us to come back

Is it all for nothing? Is it all part of a plan?
Tranquilize me and revise me, Ativan
(Ativan, my leading woman)
Is it all full circle? Is it all part of a plan?
Make my death wish, mind my business
I'm doing the best I can (with what I am)
Is it all for nothing? (All for nothing)
Is it all part of a plan? (All part of a plan)
Tranquilize me and revise me, Ativan
(Ativan, my leading woman)
Is it all full circle? (All full circle)
Is it all part of a plan? (All part of a plan)
Make my death wish, mind my business
I'm doing the best I can with what I am (with what I am)

For the love of God
In the shade of Ursa Major
For the life of me
I can't account for human nature
For your information
I'm not one for controversy
So I ask forgiveness now
Lord, reveal yourself in mercy
Call off all emergency
And look at things the way I see them
For the beauty of the Earth
It shows us wisdom, love, and rebirth


I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
Until the earth runs through it
I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
And I'm definitely gonna do it


For the love of mercy
In the face of all this danger
For the most of all my life
I feel as if I were a stranger
And all the consequences
From the throes of our persuasion
Lord, I ask for patience now
Call off all of your invasion
There's is beauty where I see it
Everywhere that I can feel it
I am on the verge of sorrow
Tell me, Lord, which road to follow

I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
Until the earth runs through it
I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
And I'm definitely gonna do it

I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
Until the earth runs through it
I wanna love you (I wanna love you), I wanna love you (I wanna love you)
And I'm definitely gonna do it

It was something of a second life
It was something of an anaphylaxis
I saw the same shit, I saw the light
You get me out of this and I'll give you access
At the risk of sounding like a Confucian
I saw your body and I saw what I liked
Let's keep it simple, give me absolution
Let's take a walk in the circle of light


It was something of an afterthought
It was something sort of unprecedented
I saw the same shit, like it or not
I saw the hemisphere I didn't invent it
It was something of a reinvention
You took my breath away, I took my time
Let's keep it simple, give me absolution
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
(Landslide)
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
(Landslide)
Let's take a walk in the circle of light


We step in the light
The rise of our tide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide



It was something of a second chance
It was something of a phantom synapsis
Now everything is slipping out of my hands
You get me out of this and I'll give you access
At the risk of sounding like a Confucian
I'm gonna take it one day at a time
Let's keep it simple, give me absolution
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
(Landslide)
Let's take a walk in the circle of light
(Landslide)
Let's take a walk in the circle of light


We step in the light
The rise of our tide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to hide
My love is a wave
You got me caught in a landslide
(Landslide)
(Landslide)
(Landslide)
(Landslide)
(Landslide)
(Landslide)
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost, forgive me
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost, forgive me
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost, forgive me
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost, forgive me
(Only the lonely)

Reach out for what remains before you
Reach out for what remains at hand
For as it was in the beginning
So shall it cease at my command
(Only the lonely)
Now place your head below your waistline
Breathe deeply as the pain subsides
And with your final breath, remember
The day of rest has now arrived
(Only the lonely)

Oh, my heart will leave you now, surrender
Oh, my heart receives you now
With arms full of harvest
Oh, my heart has fallen for its fear of feelings
Stay close to me, my love
Theosophy, in elegy love me
Oh, my heart will fantasize of Eden
My love, my dream, make love to me
Surrender your spirit, sing my eulogy
Oh, my heart is chained to thee, my angel
You haven't seen the last of me
My love, I give you everything
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost without you (Only the lonely)
Four degrees off the ground
I am lost without you (Only the lonely)
I am lost without you (Only the lonely)
I am lost without you (Only the lonely)
(I'm your ticket tonight)

Death star into space
Trash talk, violate it
What you call the human race
Go on, wipe that look off your face
Death star into space
Trash talk, violate it
Witness me resist the hate
It’s your own damn head on that plate

(I'm your ticket tonight)

Death star into space
Vandalize what you create
Trash talk, violate it
Go on, wipe that look off your face
Death star into space
What you call the human race
Expedite the judgement day (I'm your ticket tonight)
It's your own damn head on that plate

(I'm your ticket tonight)
(I'm your ticket tonight)

Death star into space
Watch me now and take the bait
Battle star, cannot fake it
Go on, let the future deflate
Death star into space
What you call the human race
Witness me, resist the hate (I'm your ticket tonight)
It's your own damn head on that plate
Death star into space
Trash talk, violate it

Here I am alone in my car
Hopelessness incorporated
I'm driving to wherever you are
Now that all of my dreams have been confiscated
Circa 1975
Now that it's too late to have died a young man
Well, I'm just glad that I'm still alive
For what hasn't killed me will make me stronger


Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact


Tell me what I already know
Nothing is left of me, all of this is vertigo
Turn around and show me your shadow
Now that I've left you, I feel all the afterglow

Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to everything out of whack


Here I am alone in my car (I'm your ticket tonight)
Hopelessly infatuated
Now I'm driving to wherever you are (I'm your ticket tonight)
Love me and leave me intoxicated


Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to that
Goodbye to all of that artifact
Goodbye to everything out of whack


(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)

Is someone gonna cut me some slack?
Now that it’s a quarter to ten
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
You tell me that you wanna fall back
But I don’t wanna do this again
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar


You stand up straight, now stand real tall
And wipe that writing off the wall
This is the right time
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Now put one foot in front of the other
Take a breath, now breathe, my lover
Let’s take up this lifeline
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar


Is that the weight of the world on your back?
Surrender with that colorful flag
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Yeah, they’ve been selling us this fiction as fact
But I don’t wanna lose you again
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Don’t make me wait (Don’t make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait (Don’t make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar


All the shit they try to feed us
Don’t drink the poison or they’ll defeat us
This is the right time
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t break my heart, don’t break my flow now
And all this rage has got to go now
Let’s take up this lifeline
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar


Don’t make me wait (Don’t make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait (Don’t make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait (Don't make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait (Don't make me wait)
Don’t make me wait too long (Don’t make me wait too long)
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Don’t make me wait
Don’t make me wait too long
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar
Don’t make me wait
Don’t make me wait too long
Don’t make me sing the sad song
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

Don’t make me wait
Come on, baby, gimme some sugar

When I am dead and the light leaves my breast
Nothing to be told, nothing to confess
Let the record show what I couldn't quite confess
For by living for myself, I was living for unrest
Then the evidence came back in a chariot of vindication
Something to behold, glorious in its path
But the prophecy fell back as it gave to me an invitation
Show them what is right, show them what is blessed


But now it strikes me far too late again
That I was asking far too much of everyone around me
And now it strikes me far too late again
That I should answer for myself as the Ascension falls upon me


So what should be said of a life that leaves its mess?
For once your life was sold it could never be possessed
You were selfishly as a continent, you were finally at your best
For you favored for yourself when selfishness was blessed
Then Cordelia came back in a chariot hallucination
Something to rejoice, glorious in its wrath
But the prophecy was a pantomime as it came to me in accusation
Show them what is right, show them what is best

But now it strikes me far too late again
That I was asking far too much of everyone around me
And now it strikes me far too late again
That I should answer for myself as the Ascension falls upon me


And now it frightens me, the thought against my chest
To think I was asking for a reason, explaining why everything's a total mess
And now it frightens me, the dreams that I possess
To think I was acting like a believer, when I was just angry and depressed


And to everything, there is no meaning, a season of pain and hopelessness
I shouldn't have looked for revelation, I should have resigned myself to this
I thought I could change the world around me, I thought I could change the world for best
I thought I was called in convocation, I thought I was sanctified and blessed


But now it strengthens me to know the truth at last
That everything comes from consummation, and everything comes with consequence
And I did it all with exultation, while you did it all with hopelessness
Yes, I did it all with adoration, while you killed it off with all of your holy mess


What now? (What now?)
(What now?)
(What now?)
(What now?)
What now? (What now?)
(What now?)
(What now?)
(What now?)
Is it love you’re after?
A sign of the flood or one more disaster
Don’t do to me what you did to America
Don’t do to me what you did to America

I have loved you, I have grieved
I’m ashamed to admit I no longer believe
I have loved you, I received
I have traded my life
For a picture of the scenery
Don’t do to me what you did to America
Don’t do to me what you did to America

I give it all up in laughter
The sign of the cross awaiting disaster
The dove flew to me like a vision of paranoia
The dove flew to me like a vision of paranoia

I have loved you like a dream
I have kissed your lips like a Judas in heat
I have worshipped, I believed
I have broke your bread for a splendor of machinery
Don’t look at me like I’m acting hysterical
Don’t look at me like I’m acting hysterical

I have worshipped, I have cried
I have put my hands in the wounds on your side
I have tasted of your blood
I have choked on the waters, I abated the flood
I am broken, I am beat
But I will find my way like a Judas in heat
I am fortune, I am free
I’m like a fever of light in the land of opportunity
Don’t do to me what you did to America
(Don’t do to me what you do to yourself)
Don’t do to me what you did to America
(Don’t do to me what you do to yourself)
Don’t do to me what you did to America
(Don’t do to me what you do to yourself)
Don’t do to me what you did to America
(Don’t do to me what you do to yourself)

Don’t do to me what you did to America
Don’t do to me what you did to America
Don’t do to me what you did to America
Don’t do to me what you did to America
