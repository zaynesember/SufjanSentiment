Thinking outrageously I write in cursive
I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor
Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
I see my own breath on the face of the door

Oh I am not quite sleeping
Oh I am fast in bed
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched

North of Savanna we swim in the Palisades
I come out wearing my brother's red hat
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times
He runs washing his face in his hands

Oh how I meant to tease him
Oh how I meant no harm
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him
I see the wasp on the length of my arm

Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelujah
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelujah

We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelujah

We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelujah


We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait

We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelujah

We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Unto us your ghost is born. Hallelujah

I can't explain the state that I'm in
The state of my heart, he was my best friend
Into the car, from the back seat
Oh, admiration in falling asleep
All of my powers, day after day
I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed
Deep in the tower, the prairies below
I can tell youâ€” the telling gets old
Terrible sting and terrible storm
I can tell you the day we were born
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelujah

My friend is gone, he ran away
I can tell you, I love him each day
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelujah

Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged
I can tell you I love him each day
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelujah

Terrible sting, terrible storm
I can tell you...
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelujah
